## ‚è∏Ô∏è PHASE 2.3: CLIP EXTRACTION (DEFERRED)

**Status:** Marked as lower priority for MVP

**Rationale:**
- Preview works by streaming from source video with time parameters
- Actual clip extraction can be added later for performance optimization
- Not critical for core functionality

**Future Enhancement:**
- Extract individual clips and cache them
- Faster preview loading
- Thumbnail generation from clips

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE SUMMARY

### Database Schema
```
projects
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ source_videos
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ transcript_segments
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ edits
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ edit_decisions
```

### API Structure
```
/api/projects/
  - CRUD for projects
  - /api/projects/{id}/source-videos/
    - CRUD for source videos
    - Transcript retrieval
  - /api/projects/{id}/edits/
    - CRUD for edits
    - EDL management (reorder, update, delete decisions)
    - Process, preview, finalize endpoints
```

### Workflow
```
1. User uploads video ‚Üí SourceVideo created
2. User processes video ‚Üí Edit created with EDL in database
3. User previews edit ‚Üí Frontend loads clips sequentially
4. User modifies EDL ‚Üí Updates stored in database
5. User finalizes ‚Üí Actual concatenation happens
6. User downloads ‚Üí Final video file served
```

## üéâ KEY ACHIEVEMENTS

1. **Complete data model** for project-based editing
2. **Non-destructive editing** with EDL storage
3. **Deferred concatenation** - only happens on finalization
4. **Full REST API** with 25+ endpoints
5. **Database-backed state** - all edits are persistent
6. **Migration path** from legacy file-based system
7. **Progress tracking** for async operations
8. **Background processing** for long-running tasks

## üöÄ READY FOR FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT

All backend infrastructure is in place and tested. The API is ready to support:
- Project management UI
- Source video upload and management
- Edit creation and management
- Text-based editing with EDL manipulation
- Video preview with pseudo-concatenation
- Finalization and export

**Next:** Begin Phase 3 - Frontend Project Management UI
